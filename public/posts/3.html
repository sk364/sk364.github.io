  Rene Descartes is a notable philosopher, mathematician, and metaphysicist. Though some may regard him as a skeptic, he uses skepticism as a tool to understand the ground reality by a way of philosophical investigation. In his famous epistemological work "Meditations on First Philosophy", he gives a systematic and methodical analysis to prove the existence of God and the distinction between mind and body.
</div>

<div class="post-paragraph">
  The book consists of six meditations, where he proceeds by abandoning all his previous beliefs, makes his way upwards through a series of careful considerations, claiming that there exists an all-too-powerful God, by the power of which we have existed and continue to exist.

  First Meditation: On what can be called into doubt
</div>

<div class="accordion-content">
  <div class="post-paragraph">
    In his first meditation, Descartes questions his very own existence and his beliefs. Discarding all that he knows, he casts everything into doubt, wanting to build his foundations with more certainty. While everything is under investigation, disproving only the roots of the opinions will be enough.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Most of all that he knows has been acquired through the senses. He acknowledges that senses can be deceitful when it comes to objects that are very small or distant. He still can feel his body, the environment. Failing to question such beliefs, he compares himself to madmen having faulty sensory systems.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    However, he realizes that many times in his dreams, he imagines all sorts of insane scenarios. What if he is imagining his head, hands, and whatnot. But then these visions are like copies of the real things, like a painting. Maybe the painter creates an entirely new painting, even then the colors are from real experiences. He then concludes that things that are simple and general, like arithmetic, geometry, size, time, etc. are real and the things dealing with complex structures in the fields of physics, astronomy, medicine, etc. can be called into doubt.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    The belief in an all-powerful God makes him question even the simplest of the beliefs. The Almighty may have illusioned him to perceive a certain reality. While God is expected to be supremely good, not letting anyone be deceived, why then does the Almighty let anyone be deceived some of the time?
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Finally, he comes to the conclusion that there could be a cunning demon who is deceiving him at times, rather than the supremely good God. All that is visible, earth, sky, stars, and all the external things, even his own body is questionable, for the demon could have malformed anything and everything around him. It is a laborious task to move away from the old opinions, but he wants to persist and strike down all the falsehoods he has believed lately.

  Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
</div>

<div class="accordion-content hidden">
  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Hoping to find anything, however small, as solid and certain, he proceeds to strip away the beliefs in his own memories, body, and everything else and starts with the only certain notion that nothing is certain.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    However, he quickly deduces that if nothing exists in the world, then he also doesn't exist, but then who is doing this thinking. That's a contradiction. But, then there's the demon who is keeping him in an illusion. Even then, if the demon forces him to think that he is nothing, he can continue to think that he is something.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    But then what is "I" in "I exist"? To answer this, he first looks at his old notion where he has a body that has shape, size, and extension, and a soul which involves itself in sense-perception and thinking. Any of the bodily features, sense-perception, and movement are open to doubt. What remains is "thinking" and that is what he finds to be inseparable from "I".
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    The gist of the argument is:
    <ul>
      <li>I think.</li>
      <li>If I am thinking, I exist.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I exist.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    The argument is valid. But is it sound? The premises seem plausible, but one can refute the argument by saying that maybe the deceiver is putting thoughts in your head and you are only aware of them. Then the argument becomes:

    <ul>
      <li>I am aware of my thoughts.</li>
      <li>If I am aware of my thoughts, I exist.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I exist.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Now, being aware of your thoughts doesn't necessarily mean that you exist and the conclusion doesn't hold. But, Descartes would reply that being aware of something is a form of thinking, hence I still am thinking and the second argument is a transformation of the first.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    To further strengthen his argument, he turns to the example of wax where he asserts that wax isn't what its color, size, or shape, as whatever those be, it still would be wax. What it actually is, is clearly understood by the implicit rules the substance follows. These rules are perceived by intellect alone.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Finally, he concludes that the perception of bodies is not through senses or by imagination, but only by the intellectual understanding of it. Hence, understanding one's own mind is easier than the body.

  Third Meditation: The existence of God
</div>

<div class="accordion-content hidden">
  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Descartes, in the third meditation, points at one thing that he's certain about that he is a thinking thing. As a general rule, he puts forward the notion that if a thing can be perceived clearly and distinctly, then it is true. Listing objects and concepts that seemed to be pretty certain in the past, he has become doubtful of them. But before he begins to be certain about anything, he realises that if he isn't certain about the existence of God, then he will never be certain about anything as he wants to remove the slightest doubt of any kind of Godly deceptions.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    To bring the argument in an ordered fashion, he first classifies thoughts into three kinds:
    <ol>
      <li>ideas</li>
      <li>volitions / emotions</li>
      <li>judgements</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Let's consider the falsity of each of the above. Ideas when considered as they are and not connected to anything, they can't be false. Imagining a kite or a dragon in the sky is true, whether they exist or not, as they exist as representation in the mind. Similarly for emotions, where one wants, whether good or evil, it is always true that one wants it. Lastly, judgements may or may not be true as they commonly involve one to resemble ideas outside of oneself. Hence, they could lead to error.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Now, ideas themselves can be categorized into innate, external and invented. Unsure about which ideas are which, Descartes continues to question the ideas generated from external things as to why he thinks that they resemble those external things. Many of them are even generated without his will. For example: the feeling of warmth from the fireplace beside him causes him to think that the heat is coming from something external to him, whether he wills it or not.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Taking the example of the sun, there are two ideas that come from it. One, that it is very small as perceived by the senses and the other that it is quite huge, deduced using astronomical reasoning. Hence, the ideas coming from outside of oneself may or may not resemble the very thing that they are coming from, requiring a more reliable source of knowledge than the sense organs.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Descartes then goes on to prove the existence of God through the next set of arguments:
    <ul>
      <li>Nothing can't be the cause of something</li>
      <li>The cause must contain as much representative reality as the effect</li>
      <li>The cause itself could be an idea as it can contain representative reality</li>
      <li>One idea can cause the other, but there can't be an infinite regression of ideas</li>
      <li>Since there can't be an infinite regression, then the ultimate cause must lead back to something which is not an idea, but an archetype (pattern)</li>
      <li>Ideas can have so much representative reality that it doesn't reside within oneself, either directly or in a higher form, so for those ideas, an individual cannot be the cause of them</li>
      <li>I have an idea of God in me.</li>
      <li>The idea of God contains infinite objective reality.</li>
      <li>Only God can contain infinite objective reality, hence God must exist.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    The very same conclusion can be reached through the following arguments as well:
  </div>

  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    One line of attack would be that all the perfections that are attributed to God are contained within oneself in a potential form and it hasn't actualised yet. This potential then is causing the idea of God and not any other higher being. But this can't possibly be as the idea of God contains nothing that is potential. Moreover, while the potential may someday lead to actuality, it will never reach infinite as there will never be any time when it won't be capable of further increase, while the God already is actually infinite and nothing can be added to His perfections.
  </div>

  <div class="post-paragraph">
    Finally, he concludes that God is not a deceiver, as natural light shows that all fraud and deception is due to some defect.
